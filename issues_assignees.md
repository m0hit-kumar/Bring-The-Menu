Issue18:Error messages
about: The error messages that appear while the user is signing in or logging in is not very user friendly, they are in a very technical language. For example if the click on login without entering any details the error says "Given string is empty or null"
Also, I feel the placement of the error messages should be at the bottom (like a snack bar) rather than in the center as users are used to such UI
